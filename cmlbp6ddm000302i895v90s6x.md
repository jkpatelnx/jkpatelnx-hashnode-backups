Understanding the Linux File System Hierarchy is a foundational skill for anyone learning Linux, DevOps, Cloud, or SRE roles. In real production environments, most issues are solved not by complex tools, but by knowing where things live - configuration files, logs, binaries, and system data.

In this article, we will explore all major Linux directories, grouped from a DevOps perspective, and understand when and why each directory is used in real-world scenarios.

Why Linux File System Knowledge Matters in DevOps As a DevOps engineer, you often:

* Troubleshoot application failures
    
* Investigate production incidents
    
* Analyze logs during outages
    
* Configure services and security
    
* Manage users, permissions, and disks All of these tasks depend on a solid understanding of the Linux file system. Knowing which directory to check first can save valuable time during incidents.

### Root of the File System

`/` : Root Directory This is the top-level directory in Linux. Every file and directory exists under `/`. I would use this when navigating the system or understanding the overall directory structure.

### User and Access Management

* `/home` : Contains home directories for normal users (for example, /home/ubuntu). I would use this when managing user environments, SSH keys, and user-level scripts.
    
* `/root` : Home directory of the root (administrator) user. I would use this when performing administrative tasks as root.
    

### Configuration and System Control (Very Important)

* `/etc` : Stores system-wide configuration files.
    
* Common examples: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/etc/passwd` I would use this when configuring services, networking, authentication, or security.
    

### Logs, State, and Runtime Data (Critical for DevOps)

* `/var` : Stores variable data that changes during system operation.
    
* `/var/log` : Contains system and application logs.
    
* Examples: `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/nginx/` I would use this first when troubleshooting failures or incidents.
    
* `/run` : Stores runtime data such as PID files and sockets. Used by services while the system is running.
    

### Temporary Storage

* `/tmp` : Stores temporary files and is often cleaned automatically on reboot. I would use this for short-lived testing, debugging, or temporary script output.
    
* `/var/tmp` : Temporary files that persist across reboots. Used for longer-running temporary processes.
    

### Essential System Binaries

* `/bin` : Contains essential commands needed for basic system operation, such as `ls`, `cp`, and `mv`. Used even in recovery mode.
    
* `/sbin` : Contains system administration commands like `mount` and `fsck`. Used mainly by root for maintenance tasks.
    

### User-Level Programs and Libraries

* `/usr` : Stores user applications and shared resources.
    
* `/usr/bin` : Most commonly used commands live here, such as `git`, `curl`, `awk`, and `sed`.
    
* `/usr/lib` : Libraries required by programs in `/usr/bin`.
    
* `/usr/share` : Architecture-independent data such as documentation and icons.
    

### Optional and Third-Party Software

* `/opt` : Used for optional or vendor-provided applications. Common in enterprise environments for software like application servers or custom tools.
    

### Hardware and Kernel Interfaces

* `/dev` : Contains device files representing hardware (for example, disks and random devices). Used when working with storage or I/O.
    
* `/proc` : A virtual filesystem providing kernel and process information. Used for debugging system and performance issues.
    
* `/sys` : Provides information about devices and kernel subsystems. Used for advanced system tuning.
    

### Boot and Mount Points

* `/boot` : Contains bootloader files and kernel images. Used during system boot and kernel upgrades.
    
* `/mnt` : Temporary mount point for filesystems.
    
* `/media` : Automatic mount point for removable media like USB drives.

### DevOps-Focused Importance Summary

* Critical for DevOps: `/etc`, `/var/log`, `/home`, `/usr/bin`, `/opt`, `/tmp`
    
* Good to Know: `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/run`, `/mnt`, `/media`
    
* Advanced/System-Level: `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/boot`
