In real-world Linux and DevOps environments, systems rarely fail all at once. Most incidents begin with small signals slightly higher CPU usage, growing logs, slow disk IO, or intermittent network issues.  
This troubleshooting drill is designed to help you build a calm, repeatable habit for handling such situations.

## Target Service for This Drill

For this runbook, we choose `ssh` as the target service. The same structure can later be reused for `docker`, `cron`, `nginx`, or any production application. Why ssh?

* It is almost always running on Linux systems
    
* It is critical for remote access
    
* Any issue with SSH has high operational impact
    

## Step 1: Environment Basics (Know Your System)

Before touching the service, always understand where you are running.

* `uname -a` : This command helps identify Kernel version, Architecture, Kernel build details. Observation to note: Confirm the system is running a stable kernel and expected architecture.
    
* `lsb_release -a` or `cat /etc/os-release` : This confirms Linux distribution, OS version, Codename. Observation to note: Useful when debugging OS-specific behavior, package issues, or log locations.

## Step 2: Filesystem Sanity (Basic Health Check)

Filesystem problems often cause hidden failures.

* `mkdir /tmp/runbook-demo` : Creating a temporary directory verifies Filesystem is writable, No permission or mount issues. Observation to note: Successful creation indicates basic filesystem health.
    
* `cp /etc/hosts /tmp/runbook-demo/hosts-copy && ls -l` : This checks File read/write capability, Disk responsiveness. Observation to note: No delay or error means disk access is functioning normally.

## Step 3: CPU and Memory Snapshot

Resource pressure is a common root cause of service issues.

* `ps or top / htop` : These commands help identify: CPU usage of sshd, Memory consumption, Unexpected spikes. Observation to note: SSH should consume minimal CPU and memory under normal conditions.
    
* `free -h` : This gives insight into Available memory, Swap usage, Memory pressure. Observation to note: Low available memory or heavy swap usage is a warning sign.

## Step 4: Disk and IO Health

Disk exhaustion can silently break services.

* `df -h` : Used to check Disk space usage, Mounted filesystems nearing full capacity. Observation to note: Any partition above 80–85% usage needs attention.
    
* `du -sh /var/log` : Helps detect: Excessive log growth, Misconfigured logging. Observation to note: Rapid log growth often indicates application or authentication issues.

## Step 5: Network Checks

Network visibility ensures the service is reachable.

* `ss -tulpn` or `netstat` : This confirms: SSH is listening on the expected port, Correct protocol binding. Observation to note: Missing or incorrect bindings indicate service or firewall issues.
    
* `ping` or `curl` : Used to verify Basic network connectivity, Local or remote reachability. Observation to note: Packet loss or delays suggest network instability.

## Step 6: Log Analysis (Most Important Step)

Logs tell the real story behind failures.

* `journalctl -u ssh -n 50` : This helps inspect Service startup errors, Authentication problems, Crashes or restarts. Observation to note: Repeated errors or warnings indicate deeper issues.
    
* `tail -n 50 /var/log/auth.log` : This reveals Login attempts, Security warnings, Permission failures. Observation to note: Multiple failed logins may indicate attacks or misconfiguration.

## If This Worsens (Next Actions)

If the issue escalates, the run-book should guide your next move:

1. `Restart` the service gracefully during a safe window
    
2. Increase logging verbosity to capture deeper insights
    
3. Use advanced tools like `strace` or enable audit logs for investigation
